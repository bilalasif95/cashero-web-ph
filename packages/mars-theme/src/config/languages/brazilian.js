A key term here is “APY” (annual percentage yield).",
    Learn_more_savings_P6: "APY & high-yield savings accounts – An example",
    Learn_more_savings_P7: "In most cases, a high-yield savings account enables you to earn around 0.50% APY. In simple terms, APY is the number that tells you what your money could earn within a fiscal year. So the higher the APY, the more money for you, because the faster your balance will grow without any extra efforts on your behalf. Therefore, a high-yield savings account offering 5% APY is way more rewarding than a traditional savings account. Just consider that the national average savings rate is in the 0.05% APY region. Not so great...",
    Learn_more_savings_P8: "Let’s use an example to help you understand the magnitude of what we’re talking about. Assume that you have $10,000 in a high-yield savings account. With a 5% APY you would earn slightly over $500 after 12 months. Compare that to a 0.05% APY and you’d only earn a humble $5. That’s the difference Cashero makes to your money.",

This climbs to 20% if you want to skip mortgage insurance. So on a $200,000 home, you would need to save $7,000, $10,000, and $40,000 respectively for each of these payments. Having a high-yield savings account paying 5% APY, you would need 6 months, 12 months, and 36 months respectively, to save the kind of money required for the down payment (with an initial deposit of $1,000 and around $750-$1100 each month).

Although a college saving plan (i.e., a 529 plan) is an excellent option as the funds grow tax-free (even if you take the money out to pay for college), a high-yield savings account is definitely a solid alternative.

A temporary promotional rate, for example, may seem appealing at first but could be much lower later on. Economic factors may also cause financial institutions to lower their APY (e.g. the coronavirus-related emergency rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in 2019). If you can find a savings account with a guaranteed rate for 6-12 months, then you’ve done yourself a favour. If you can find one that pays you 5% permanently then you’re either very smart or very lucky.",
    Learn_more_savings_P29_P1: "This amount varies across financial institutions, with some of them requiring an initial deposit of at least $10,000 to open an account while others require nothing.

When trading foreign exchange with margin, bear in mind that factors like how large the trade size is will determine your margin requirement. Margins are usually expressed as a % of the full position. For example, a trade on USD/EUR may require you to pay only 1% of the total value of the position so you can open it. This means that instead of depositing GBP 100,000, you will be called to deposit GBP 1,000.",
    Lot: "Lot",
    Lot_P: "This refers to currency batches that are used to standardize foreign exchange currency trades. Lots usually consist of many units of the base currency (around 100.000 or more), considering that Forex does tend to move in small amounts. This means that nearly all forex trading is leveraged because individual traders don’t usually have $100.000 (or another currency) to place on every trade.",
    Pip: "Pip",
    Pip_P: "We use pips to measure a Forex pair’s movement. To understand pips, look at the 4th decimal place of a currency pair. A one-digit movement here equals to one pip. So, if USD/GBP moves from $1.35471 to $1.35481, it has moved one pip. The only exception is when the listed currency has smaller denominations. For example, if you're trading Japanese yen, a single pip is a movement in the 2nd decimal place.",

    instant_money_transfer_P1: "Choosing The Right Platform For Your Instant Money Transfers",
    instant_money_transfer_P2: "Financial emergencies happen. Overdue bills, unforeseen medical expenses, family crises, and even car breakdowns are all a part of life that may require a fast transfer of money. In these scenarios, you want to make sure you find the right provider to meet your particular needs. But how do you choose the right one? What do you need to know about instant money transfers to make sure nothing goes awry and the money gets where it needs to go?",
    instant_money_transfer_P3: "How “instant” are instant money transfers?",
    instant_money_transfer_P4: "It depends on the selected money transfer company. In most cases, “instant” means “within a few seconds or minutes”. Although many companies claim instant money transfer services, their transactions may take a little while before they eventually clear. This is because the transfer speed is affected by several factors.",
    instant_money_transfer_P5: "What factors affect the speed of money transfers?",
    instant_money_transfer_P6: "The four major factors affecting transfer speed are:",
    instant_money_transfer_P7: "The countries between which you are transferring money",
    instant_money_transfer_P8: "If you're transferring funds between countries where foreign money transfers are more commonplace or occur more frequently, the transaction is usually fast. For example, if you're transferring funds from the USA to the UK, you can expect near-instant transfer services. Less common transfers (i.e., from the USA to Honduras) will take a bit longer. But with advances in financial technology, and the rising of online payment providers like Cashero, global transfers are happening faster than ever.",
    instant_money_transfer_P9: "The way the money is received",
    instant_money_transfer_P10: "When funds are transferred, there are different ways they can be received by the beneficiary. Some methods of receipt are faster than others. Here are the most common:",
    Cash_transfers: "Cash transfers",
    E_wallet_transfers: "E-wallet transfers",
    Bank_debit_card_transfers: "Bank & debit card transfers",
    Directly_to_the_recipients_account: "Directly to the recipient’s account",
    Cash_transfers_P: "Most providers offering instant money transfers do so in the form of cash pickups. This means that the person receiving that money can collect it from a designated agent location the moment you deposit the funds. Cash transfers are typically the fastest way to send money overseas. Requiring the recipient to go to a physical location for a money transfer enables the company to verify the transaction immediately and payout the funds. So, funds are transferred instantly. However cash transfers can come with high fees and potentially poor exchange rates.",
    E_wallet_transfers_P: "Some providers allow you to transfer money instantly to electronic or mobile wallets. With these kinds of transfers we enter the world of FinTech - Financial Technology. FinTech Payment Providers, like Cashero, now lead the industry in terms of transfer speed, costs of fees, and ease of use.",
    Bank_debit_card_transfers_P: "These types of transfers save you from having to visit a physical location to send money. The tradeoff for convenience is that bank account or debit card transfers usually come with extra fees and may take between 1- 5 business days to clear (though in many cases the transfer is instant). The reason for this delay is that the bank needs to verify the transaction first before it allows the transfer. If both banks involved are on a network (i.e., SEPA), the money transfer process might be faster than regular international bank transfers.",
    Directly_to_the_recipients_account_P: "This is a bank-related option to send money to another individual overseas. This type of transfer may not be instantaneous, but usually takes only a few hours to process. However if the bank uses SWIFT for their transfer network, the sender may incur a fee for making the transfer “instantaneous”, sometimes upwards of $25.",
    instant_money_transfer_P11: "The money transfer company",
    instant_money_transfer_P12: "The money transfer process can vary depending on the transfer company you choose to do business with. The efficacy of the selected company’s sending, exchanging, and receiving funds procedures will determine the speed of transfer.",
    instant_money_transfer_P13: "Having an account with a payment provider",
    instant_money_transfer_P14: "If you'll be opening an account with a money transfer company that offers money instant transfer services now, the provider will need to verify your account. With Cashero our KYC process is simple and efficient, so you can be signed up and ready to make any transfer you need, almost immediately. This may take some time, though usually not more than a few hours, depending on the selected provider’s processes.",
    instant_money_transfer_P15: "If you already have an active account with a provider, you can deposit your money and the recipient/beneficiary will receive it almost instantly. It's vital to ensure that the chosen provider is equipped to send money to and from the necessary countries. Some providers, for example, specialize in money transfers between the USA and the UK, while others offer faster European international transfers.",
    instant_money_transfer_P16: "Sending an instant money transfer – How does it work?",
    instant_money_transfer_P17: "The process is pretty straightforward. You send money by supplying the required amount to a transfer company agent or online platform. Once the transfer is complete the recipient has access to the funds either in person or electronically. Although the exact fund transfer procedure may differ among providers, the basic steps are as follows:",
    Register: "Register",
    Initiate_the_money_transfer: "Initiate the money transfer",
    Provide_the_recipients_information: "Provide the recipient’s information",
    Pay_for_the_transfer: "Pay for the transfer",
    Register_P: "You will most likely be asked to provide some personal details (i.e., name, email address, etc.). Some providers also request evidence of where you got the money you are sending. For online platforms, you will need to create an account.",
    Initiate_the_money_transfer_P: "For those sending funds through an online platform, use your login credentials to access your account. Sending funds can also be achieved by visiting a provider’s nearest physical location.",
    Provide_the_recipients_information_P: "The provider will ask you to provide the recipient’s personal details (i.e., name, currency in which they will collect the money, and account details). Note that you should enter the correct information (i.e., the recipient’s name should match the one on their ID and account precisely).",
    Pay_for_the_transfer_P: "This step involves funding your transfer, if applicable. Different providers will accept different payment methods, including cash, check, or bank withdrawal.",
    instant_money_transfer_Note: "If the transfer recipient is making a cash collection, you will most likely need to provide them with the transaction number or PIN. The agent in the recipient’s country will ask for that number or PIN to verify the transaction. Without it, the recipient will probably not be able to collect their money.",
    instant_money_transfer_P18: "Is sending an instant transfer anywhere in the world possible?",
    instant_money_transfer_P19: "In most cases, yes. But the answer to this question largely depends on the selected provider. This allows for instant money transfers to nearly any location. Nevertheless, sending funds to less-commonly used countries or routes can be more difficult and may take more time.",
    instant_money_transfer_P20: "Sending large amounts of money via instant money transfers",
    instant_money_transfer_P21: "Again, this depends on the transfer company you choose to send money with. Each one has its own limit on how much you can send via an instant money transfer service. Depending on the service, you won’t be able to send very large amounts using an instant money transfer. However, your definition of “large” will determine the answer to this question. Most transfer companies have both daily and weekly limits in place on the amount of money you can send. So be sure to learn what their limit is before signing up. For many providers, handling five-figure sums is quite challenging.",
    instant_money_transfer_P22: "Reversing instant money transfers",
    instant_money_transfer_P23: "Unfortunately in the majority of cases, cancelling or reversing a transfer is not possible. Once you initiate the instant funds transfer process, little can be done to reverse it. In fact, as soon as you deposit the money, there is usually no turning back. The procedure will automatically end when the money is delivered to the intended recipient. Given this, it is important to carefully check all details before starting an instant money transfer.",
    instant_money_transfer_P24: "Tips to speed up your instant money transfer",

    Be_prepared_P: "Creating an account with a money transfer company and verifying it beforehand will most likely boost your instant money transfer experience. The same applies to having the recipient’s details early on. Furthermore, entering the right details (both yours and the beneficiary's) will also prevent slowdowns in the procedure.",
    Check_the_supported_currencies_P: "Does your selected provider support the currencies you need? For example, Cashero allows you to send money in USD, EUR, and GBP. This means that your recipient can also receive funds in these currencies.  You can withdraw money from Cashero in your local currency.",
    Ensure_the_safety_of_your_transfer_P: "First of all, it's advised not to rush sending large sums to help avoid making a mistake that may delay the process. It's also worth inquiring how the provider protects your money. Cashero, for instance, uses complex security layers, including MPC (multi-party computation) and hardware isolation, to ensure safe transactions.",
    Compare_providers_P: "It's paramount to find the provider that offers the fastest and most reliable money transfer services. If you can also find a trusted provider offering fast and 24/7 customer service, even better.",
    Check_the_cost_involved_P: "Costly fees can inflate the overall cost of the transaction. That's why you should check the exchange rate margins and transfer fees offered by various providers. Some providers charge a mark-up exchange rate (usually around 1%-2%), others charge a fixed fee (normally, between $1.99-$24.99), and there are even providers that charge both. Note that higher exchange rates can affect the transfer cost dramatically, especially if you're sending large sums.",

    transfer_money_abroad_P2: "International money transfers can be confusing, and many people have a hard time wrapping their heads around security concerns, unclear fees, and different services. Sending money abroad, however, does not necessarily need to be so challenging.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P3: "With Cashero, we’ve made it easy.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P4: "Whether you need to pay a freelancer abroad, fund a university course in the UK, or buy a summer home on a Mediterranean island (we can dream, can’t we?), you will most likely need to send money overseas. The truth is that you have plenty of options, but which one is best for you? You are probably already familiar with a few choices, especially if you have sent money online in the past to pay for goods or services.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P5: "In a nutshell, you can normally transfer money abroad through your bank or a FinTech (financial technology) online provider, like Cashero. The latter offers easier, cheaper, and quicker transactions than banks.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P6: "Alternatively, you may use FX (foreign exchange) brokers or a specialist high street transfer service. In the first case, you can expect relatively good deals and a preferential rate. In the second case, you enjoy convenience as you will probably not be asked to set up an account so you can send the cash. But these two ways aren’t quite so user-friendly for the everyday individual.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P7: "The most common ways to send money internationally",
    transfer_money_abroad_P8: "Let’s dive into some more details about the three most used options to send money abroad:",
    Banks: "Banks",
    FinTech_companies: "FinTech companies",
    Money_transfer_operators: "Money transfer operators",
    Banks_P: "Transferring money abroad via your high street bank account is one of the most secure ways to transfer funds internationally. The good thing about bank transfers is that you can send quite a lot of cash in one go (even up to $50,000-$100,000) with most banks. In addition, an international online transaction can be pulled through either by walking into a branch or over the phone. Expect some delays in clearing a transaction though; depending on where you are sending money to and from, there could be a delay of up to four or five business days. This means getting money quickly to someone abroad in an emergency is usually not an option with Bank transfers. Also, beware of the fees in this situation — you may incur transaction fees or a high exchange rate from some banks. The recipient may also have to pay a fee to be able to collect the cash you send them. While bank transfers were traditionally the most common method of transferring money abroad in years past, advancements in technology have given rise to the more sophisticated and user-friendly options, in the form of FinTech payment providers.",
    FinTech_companies_P: "Financial technology or FinTech companies entice with varying offerings. Some of them charge a transfer fee but provide competitive exchange rates. Others charge no fees but require up to 3-4 days for your funds to reach the intended account. Deciding which one to choose depends on what you are after and the method of sending. Will you use a credit/debit card or opt for the funds to be transferred from your bank account? These can determine the fees and delivery time.",
    Money_transfer_operators_P: "When sending money overseas, you will probably find several high-street money transfer operators. These usually offer process times between 24-48 hours, with fees varying depending on the selected method to send money, the location, and the currency. What is paramount, however, before deciding to use their services is to ensure the chosen operator is properly authorized by your country’s governing financial services regulator. In the UK, for example, this would be the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority). Also, take note of the offered exchange rates as some operators’ rates are particularly high, and you may see corresponding high fees as well.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P9: "The best way to transfer money abroad",
    transfer_money_abroad_P10: "Given that cash can be stolen at any given time during a transfer, it's probably best to send it abroad via an online service. That way, you also save yourself from extra charges (i.e., insurance for safe delivery), not to mention the time it will probably take for your funds to arrive. Plus, who really sends physical cash these days? Luckily, with such a wealth of digital services offering easy availability, safety, and convenience, money is rarely sent via the mail anymore.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P11: "It should be noted that choosing a bank wire transfer to send money overseas usually comes with a hefty fee that can range between $45-$60 per transaction. In addition to this, the exchange rate might be higher if you are sending funds in a different currency. This is why money transfer apps, like Cashero, have seen such a rise in the past few years as they offer fast, secure, easy, and cheap money transfer services. They are more consumer-friendly, offer the upsides of modern security, along with ease of use.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P12: "The least secure ways to transfer money abroad",
    transfer_money_abroad_P13: "When it comes to the less secure alternatives to send money internationally, these would probably be cashier’s checks, unless you're using one to give money to someone in person. International money orders are also not secure, especially for large sums, because they are often lost in the mail. However, you can replace an international money order (for a fee) if it has not been cashed. Finally, it's best to avoid personal checks. If the wrong person gets your check, they instantly gain access to your routing or bank account number.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P14: "Sending money abroad – How secure is it?",
    transfer_money_abroad_P15: "As already mentioned before, it's critical that the selected organization or service is regulated by the relevant authorities. It's also paramount that they have taken all security measures for safe money transfers.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P16: "What makes a money transfer safe?",

    Encryption: "Encryption",
    Tracking: "Tracking",
    Fraud_prevention: "Fraud prevention",
    ID_verification_P: "This can involve using security questions, requiring a secure password, allowing only the intended recipient to pick up your money, and logging you out automatically after a set amount of time has passed since the time you logged in. At Cashero we use One Time Passwords (OPT) to ensure your transfers are secure.",
    Encryption_P: "Some providers offer 256-bit or bank-level encryption to prevent hackers from getting their hands on your personal information.",
    Tracking_P: "Depending on the provider you choose, you might be provided with the ability to track your transfer. Using the confirmation number, the provider will give you, you could see where your funds are at any given moment until receipt.",
    Fraud_prevention_P: "Fraud prevention tactics may be triggered by activities such as sending funds to a suspicious recipient, sending an unusually large number of transfers, and logging in from a different device than the one you created your account with. When that happens, you might be asked to verify your identity with the money transfer provider, provide a confirmation number sent to your phone or email, or answer security questions.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P18: "Transfer money overseas – The costs",
    transfer_money_abroad_P19: "When you're sending funds abroad, it's essential that you're aware of the costs involved — and that you know exactly what you're paying for. These charges are usually calculated in the following two ways:",
    Fees: "Fees",
    Exchange_rates: "Exchange rates",
    Fees_P: "Expect some operating costs when doing business with a foreign exchange company. It's a business after all. This means that they have employees to pay, pay money on things like renewing their licenses, and premises to rent. A portion of these costs is passed on to you via fees. Note that most financial institutions and FX brokers will hardly give you an upfront estimate of such costs.",
    Exchange_rates_P: "These determine how much of a specific currency you can buy with another currency. For example, how many euros you can purchase for $50. There is usually a catch here, though. Some providers add an inflated mark-up on top of the real-time market exchange rate. That way, they are actually asking you to pay for their resources and time. So, it's crucial to understand whether the provider offers real-time exchange rates like the ones you will find via Reuters or Google – with no fees or mark-ups.",

    Laws_and_regulations: "Laws and regulations",
    Timing_P: "Most of the time, when you transfer money abroad, the recipient receives it almost instantly. This, however, has to do with the specific services offered and the provider you choose. So with some providers, the money transfer process can take a few minutes, while others require five or more business days to clear your transaction. Note that sending money during bank holidays or over a weekend may affect the time your money transfer takes significantly. That is if you're using primarily bank transfers. When you go with online providers, you can ensure that no matter the day or time, be it a holiday or weekend, your money always gets where you need it to go, almost instantly.",
    Access_and_ease_P: "The new-generation fintech-style money apps make sending money abroad feel like a walk in the park. In the majority of cases, you simply download a user-friendly and easy-to-navigate app, register, and verify your account. Then, you're free to send funds internationally within minutes using your debit card, or another method of transfer.",

However, it's paramount to be in line with the local and international laws so that your transaction is not regarded as an act of money laundering.
