    Learn_more_savings_P2: "The term “high yield” may intrigue a lot of people interested in being financially savvy with their savings. But is it that attractive of an option, and can it be possibly used to mislead consumers?",
    Learn_more_savings_P3: "We've put together this guide to help you know what to expect from a high-yield savings account, whether it's a good fit for you, your funds, and your future.",
    Learn_more_savings_P4: "What is a high-yield savings account?",
    Learn_more_savings_P5: "A high-yield savings account is a savings account offering higher than average rates of return on the amount deposited. These rates are better than the national average and are usually tied to specific conditions for the savings account, such as maintenance fees and minimum balance requirements. A key term here is “APY” (annual percentage yield).",
    Learn_more_savings_P6: "APY & high-yield savings accounts – An example",
    Learn_more_savings_P7: "In most cases, a high-yield savings account enables you to earn around 0.50% APY. In simple terms, APY is the number that tells you what your money could earn within a fiscal year. So the higher the APY, the more money for you, because the faster your balance will grow without any extra efforts on your behalf. Therefore, a high-yield savings account offering 5% APY is way more rewarding than a traditional savings account. Just consider that the national average savings rate is in the 0.05% APY region. Not so great...",
    Learn_more_savings_P8: "Let’s use an example to help you understand the magnitude of what we’re talking about. Assume that you have $10,000 in a high-yield savings account. With a 5% APY you would earn slightly over $500 after 12 months. Compare that to a 0.05% APY and you’d only earn a humble $5. That’s the difference Cashero makes to your money.",
    Learn_more_savings_P9: "Important notes:",
    Learn_more_savings_P10: "Some high yield savings accounts even have rates of return that decrease rapidly after a certain time period. More often than not, it can even result in a lower-than-average rate of return.",
    Learn_more_savings_P11: "Why consider a high APY savings account instead of another savings account type?",
    Learn_more_savings_P12: "If you wish to access your money regularly or fast then a high APY savings account is definitely for you, especially an online account. With an online account, you have 24/7 (and secure) access to your savings account and typically have to pay fewer fees than traditional banks.",
    Learn_more_savings_P13: "Given that they’re not hampered by the brick-and-mortar expenses of traditional institutions, online accounts pass their savings on to their customers in the form of higher returns. High APY savings accounts are also a good place to put your money if you would rather avoid taking risks. See below for more information on these types of savings accounts.",

    Learn_more_savings_P21_p1: "– A Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan requires a down payment of 3.5% or more. Traditional conforming loans, 5% or more. This climbs to 20% if you want to skip mortgage insurance. So on a $200,000 home, you would need to save $7,000, $10,000, and $40,000 respectively for each of these payments. Having a high-yield savings account paying 5% APY, you would need 6 months, 12 months, and 36 months respectively, to save the kind of money required for the down payment (with an initial deposit of $1,000 and around $750-$1100 each month). Saving is never a quick task, but using a high-yield savings account will get you to your goal faster than a typical savings account.",
    Learn_more_savings_P22_P1: "– Everybody knows that college tuition costs can become overwhelming purely because of the amount needed. Although a college savings plan (i.e., a 529 plan) is an excellent option as the funds grow tax-free (even if you take the money out to pay for college), a high-yield savings account is definitely a solid alternative. Using an online savings goal calculator can help you to plan how much you need to save on a regular basis to reach your savings goal by a certain date.",

    Learn_more_savings_P25_P1: "– According to the 2019 Real Wedding Study published by The Knot, the average wedding cost (not including the honeymoon) is nearly $34,000. With a high-yield savings account offering, say, 5% APY, you could save that kind of money for the big day in a shorter time frame. You could do the same for other expenses with a short timeline, such as buying furniture, a vehicle, or even to have money aside for estimated taxes.",
    Learn_more_savings_P26: "Things to consider when choosing a high-yield savings account",
    Learn_more_savings_P27: "First and foremost, it's important to weigh the APY against the set requirements to earn the interest. For example, one institution may offer a slightly higher APY than another. However, the second institution may require a higher minimum balance and deposit to open the savings account. Other things to factor in before deciding to open an account are:",

    Learn_more_savings_P28_P1: "– Check how often the financial institution you want to do business with adjusts its interest rates. Unlike other financial products, the return rate of savings accounts tends to be variable rather than locked in for a period of time. A temporary promotional rate, for example, may seem appealing at first but could be much lower later on. Economic factors may also cause financial institutions to lower their APY (e.g. the coronavirus-related emergency rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in 2019). If you can find a savings account with a guaranteed rate for 6-12 months, then you’ve done yourself a favour. If you can find one that pays you 5% permanently then you’re either very smart or very lucky.",
    Learn_more_savings_P29_P1: "– This amount varies across financial institutions, with some of them requiring an initial deposit of at least $10,000 to open a high yield account while others require nothing. Most of them, however, will probably ask for a minimum deposit of $100 or less. Determining how much you can deposit (realistically) will help compare high-yield savings products and decide which one best suits your needs.",
    Learn_more_savings_P30_P1: "– Failing to meet the minimum balance requirements of some high-yield savings accounts can result in fees or failure to earn the high APY you wanted. This figure can be pretty large, sometimes even greater than $10,000. A monthly maintenance fee is just one of the charges you may need to pay if you do not maintain a minimum balance in your savings account. Luckily, Cashero doesn’t have a minimum balance requirement.",
    Learn_more_savings_P31_P1: "– As a saver, you may be limited to six withdrawals per month from your savings account due to Reg D or Regulation D. The only exception is when you withdraw in-person at a bank or from an ATM.",

However, details like minimum balance requirements with the bank should always be clarified beforehand. Furthermore, according to experts, multi-currency accounts charge higher fees than some other types of bank accounts. These may include fees on withdrawals from ATMs and transaction fees. Some banks charge account management fees, usually on a 12-month basis. As for the per annum interest rates, they are generally announced in advance for the quarter for each foreign currency, so it's good to be prepared. With Cashero, there are no management fees, so you get to keep every cent of the money you make.",

    online_currency_exchange_learn_2: "Online currency exchanges are becoming more common every day. This makes a lot of sense in today's world, given that there are over 180 different currencies already recognized as legal tender worldwide. Online currency exchanges are pretty much a necessity for global trade and commerce. It’s no wonder, then, that currency traders, brokerage firms, banks, and other brick and mortar financial institutions saw huge potential in providing currency exchange services years ago.",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_3: "Whether you're a traveler, a company doing business with an international clientele, or an individual wanting to pay for services or goods across the globe, you will most likely need to convert currencies from one form to another. And, thanks to the Internet, you can now do so online using currency exchange sites. But what exactly are online currency exchanges and how do they work? And what options might be available for personal use if you want to keep multiple currencies at once?",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_4: "What is currency exchange trading?",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_5: "Also known as forex (foreign exchange), currency exchange trading refers to a network of traders (buyers and sellers) that wish to convert one currency into another at a prearranged price. The majority of forex transactions are done for practical reasons (i.e., to travel abroad). Many people, though, choose to convert currency to earn a profit. Foreign exchanges can be particularly attractive to traders, especially when the amount of currency transferred daily can bring a greater chance of high profit (aka currency volatility). But now more than ever, everyday people are wanting the ability to hold multiple currencies at once, along with the ability to change in and out of them at will. Currency exchange platforms like Cashero were built with them in mind.",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_6: "What are currency exchange platforms?",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_7: "These refer to online-based websites that enable people and corporations to convert currencies, irrespective of where they are in the world. Most of the time, these platforms allow involved parties to explore the exchange currencies and financial market conditions safely. Bringing immediate transparency into play, they feature a centralized and secure setting that usually provides tools like a universal currency converter. This is an application that you can use to help convert currency values based on the exchange rates of the day.",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_8: "When is the best time to use a currency exchange?",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_9: "To begin with, you will most likely need the services of an online currency exchange site if you are traveling in a foreign country. In this case, most people prefer to convert their money before making the journey as a means to ensure better rates. As for organizations, utilizing an online currency exchange can help make trading with other companies or individuals easier. This is particularly true when engaging in international trade or business.",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_10: "What about Forex trades? Do they take place on an exchange?",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_11: "In a nutshell, no. Unlike commodities and shares that require an exchange to take place, Forex trading is done in an OTC (over-the-counter) market, directly between two parties. The Forex currency market is run by a global network of financial institutions, spread across Tokyo, Sydney, New York, and London – the big four Forex trading centers. This enables Forex trading on a 24/7 basis.",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_12: "As of now, there are three primary types of Forex market:",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_13_1: "Future Forex market",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_13_2: "The trader agrees to trade (buy or sell) a set amount of a given currency. The contract is legally binding and forces the trader to trade the specified currency at an agreed price and date.",

    online_currency_exchange_learn_14_2: "The trader agrees to a contract (not legally binding) where they sell or buy a set amount of a currency at a prearranged value. The trade will be settled either within a range of future dates or a specific date in the future.",

    online_currency_exchange_learn_16: "How Forex trading works?",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_17: "You can trade foreign currencies in various ways. However, they all share the same basics in regards to how the process goes. The common concept in them all is that trading Forex involves buying one currency and simultaneously selling another. Traditionally, one would need to turn to a Forex broker to make a Forex transaction. Nevertheless, the growth of online trading enables traders to benefit from price movements using CFD trading and other derivatives.",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_18: "CFDs are products (leveraged) that allow traders to take a position on whether they believe the market will fall or rise in value. This means that they (traders) do not take ownership of the asset and only open a position for a fraction of the trade’s full value. However, if you're interested in CFDs, it's best to be extra careful. They can indeed boost your profits, but they can also lead to major losses. This is the same with all leveraged products.",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_19: "What affects currency exchange rates?",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_20: "Global supply and demand is one of the most critical factors that affects how exchange rates fluctuate. In simpler terms, a currency in high demand enjoys increased value. Of the factors that influence a currency's supply and demand, the most common ones are:",

It should be noted that even a 1% fluctuation in the market rates can hinder the purchase of, say, your dream home. That is if you are transferring money to buy property.",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_22: "Calculating online currency exchange rates",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_23: "The foreign exchange rate can be affected by the volume of the currency being traded at any given time. The attractiveness of a particular currency dictates whether its trading volume will increase or decrease. In other words, a competitively priced currency will most likely drive traders to buy that specific currency. This will, in turn, increase its value (or price).",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_24: "That aside, the foreign exchange rate is also affected by government central banks themselves, which can set a currency at a constant price that will determine its value over another currency (aka the pegging method).",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_25: "Must-know online currency exchange terms",
    online_currency_exchange_learn_26: "When it comes to Forex trading, it's good to know basic terminology:",
    Spread: "Spread",
    Spread_P: "This is the difference between the sell and buy prices set on a foreign exchange currency pair. When you open a forex position, you're being provided with two prices. If you wish to open a short position, you trade a currency pair at a price slightly below the market sell price. Opening a long position means that you trade a currency pair at a slightly higher buy market price.",
    Leverage: "Leverage",
    Leverage_P: "This is the process where you put down a small initial deposit (aka margin) to open and keep a leveraged position without paying the full trade value upfront. The full size of the trade is taken into account, though, to calculate your profit or loss when you close the leveraged position. When trading foreign exchange with margin, bear in mind that factors like how large the trade size is will determine your margin requirement. Margins are usually expressed as a % of the full position. For example, a trade on USD/EUR may require you to pay only 1% of the total value of the position so you can open it. This means that instead of depositing GBP 100,000, you will be called to deposit GBP 1,000.",
    Lot: "Lot",
    Lot_P: "This refers to currency batches that are used to standardize foreign exchange currency trades. Lots usually consist of many units of the base currency (around 100.000 or more), considering that Forex does tend to move in small amounts. This means that nearly all forex trading is leveraged because individual traders don’t usually have $100.000 (or another currency) to place on every trade.",
    Pip: "Pip",
    Pip_P: "We use pips to measure a Forex pair’s movement. To understand pips, look at the 4th decimal place of a currency pair. A one-digit movement here equals to one pip. So, if USD/GBP moves from $1.35471 to $1.35481, it has moved one pip. The only exception is when the listed currency has smaller denominations. For example, if you're trading Japanese yen, a single pip is a movement in the 2nd decimal place.",

Overdue bills, unforeseen medical expenses, family crises, and even car breakdowns are all a part of life that may require a fast transfer of money. In these scenarios, you want to make sure you find the right provider to meet your particular needs. But how do you choose the right one? What do you need to know about instant money transfers to make sure nothing goes awry and the money gets where it needs to go?",
    instant_money_transfer_P3: "How “instant” are instant money transfers?",
    instant_money_transfer_P4: "It depends on the selected money transfer company. In most cases, “instant” means “within a few seconds or minutes”. Although many companies claim instant money transfer services, their transactions may take a little while before they eventually clear. This is because the transfer speed is affected by several factors.",

    instant_money_transfer_P6: "The four major factors affecting transfer speed are:",
    instant_money_transfer_P7: "The countries between which you are transferring money",
    instant_money_transfer_P8: "If you're transferring funds between countries where foreign money transfers are more commonplace or occur more frequently, the transaction is usually fast. For example, if you're transferring funds from the USA to the UK, you can expect near-instant transfer services. Less common transfers (i.e., from the USA to Honduras) will take a bit longer. But with advances in financial technology, and the rising of online payment providers like Cashero, global transfers are happening faster than ever.",
    instant_money_transfer_P9: "The way the money is received",

    Directly_to_the_recipients_account: "Directly to the recipient’s account",
    Cash_transfers_P: "Most providers offering instant money transfers do so in the form of cash pickups. This means that the person receiving that money can collect it from a designated agent location the moment you deposit the funds. Cash transfers are typically the fastest way to send money overseas. Requiring the recipient to go to a physical location for a money transfer enables the company to verify the transaction immediately and payout the funds. So, funds are transferred instantly. However cash transfers can come with high fees and potentially poor exchange rates.",
    E_wallet_transfers_P: "Some providers allow you to transfer money instantly to electronic or mobile wallets. With these kinds of transfers we enter the world of FinTech - Financial Technology. FinTech Payment Providers, like Cashero, now lead the industry in terms of transfer speed, costs of fees, and ease of use.",
    Bank_debit_card_transfers_P: "These types of transfers save you from having to visit a physical location to send money. The tradeoff for convenience is that bank account or debit card transfers usually come with extra fees and may take between 1- 5 business days to clear (though in many cases the transfer is instant). The reason for this delay is that the bank needs to verify the transaction first before it allows the transfer. If both banks involved are on a network (i.e., SEPA), the money transfer process might be faster than regular international bank transfers.",
    Directly_to_the_recipients_account_P: "This is a bank-related option to send money to another individual overseas. This type of transfer may not be instantaneous, but usually takes only a few hours to process. However if the bank uses SWIFT for their transfer network, the sender may incur a fee for making the transfer “instantaneous”, sometimes upwards of $25.",
    instant_money_transfer_P11: "The money transfer company",
    instant_money_transfer_P12: "The money transfer process can vary depending on the transfer company you choose to do business with. The efficacy of the selected company’s sending, exchanging, and receiving funds procedures will determine the speed of transfer.",

    instant_money_transfer_P14: "If you'll be opening an account with a money transfer company that offers money instant transfer services now, the provider will need to verify your account. With Cashero our KYC process is simple and efficient, so you can be signed up and ready to make any transfer you need, almost immediately. This may take some time, though usually not more than a few hours, depending on the selected provider’s processes.",
    instant_money_transfer_P15: "If you already have an active account with a provider, you can deposit your money and the recipient/beneficiary will receive it almost instantly. It's vital to ensure that the chosen provider is equipped to send money to and from the necessary countries.

    Initiate_the_money_transfer_P: "For those sending funds through an online platform, use your login credentials to access your account. Sending funds can also be achieved by visiting a provider’s nearest physical location.",
    Provide_the_recipients_information_P: "The provider will ask you to provide the recipient’s personal details (i.e., name, currency in which they will collect the money, and account details). Note that you should enter the correct information (i.e., the recipient’s name should match the one on their ID and account precisely).",
    Pay_for_the_transfer_P: "This step involves funding your transfer, if applicable. Different providers will accept different payment methods, including cash, check, or bank withdrawal.",
    instant_money_transfer_Note: "If the transfer recipient is making a cash collection, you will most likely need to provide them with the transaction number or PIN. The agent in the recipient’s country will ask for that number or PIN to verify the transaction. Without it, the recipient will probably not be able to collect their money.",
    instant_money_transfer_P18: "Is sending cash through an instant transfer anywhere in the world possible?",
    instant_money_transfer_P19: "In most cases, yes instant transfers are possible to anywhere in the world. But the answer to this question largely depends on the selected provider. This allows for instant money transfers to nearly any location. Nevertheless, sending funds to less-commonly used countries or routes can be more difficult and may take more time.",
    instant_money_transfer_P20: "Sending large amounts of money via instant transfers",
    instant_money_transfer_P21: "Again, this depends on the transfer company you choose to send money with. Each one has its own limit on how much you can send via an instant money transfer service. Depending on the service, you won’t be able to send very large amounts using an instant money transfer. However, your definition of “large” will determine the answer to this question. Most transfer companies have both daily and weekly limits in place on the amount of money you can send. So be sure to learn what their limit is before signing up. For many providers, handling five-figure sums is quite challenging.",
    instant_money_transfer_P22: "Reversing instant online money transfers",
    instant_money_transfer_P23: "Unfortunately in the majority of cases, cancelling or reversing a transfer is not possible. Once you initiate the instant funds transfer process, little can be done to reverse it. In fact, as soon as you deposit the money, there is usually no turning back.

Some providers charge a mark-up exchange rate (usually around 1%-2%), others charge a fixed fee (normally, between $1.99-$24.99), and there are even providers that charge both.

    Money_transfer_operators: "Money transfer operators",
    Banks_P: "Transferring money abroad via your high street bank account is one of the most secure ways to transfer funds internationally. The good thing about bank transfers is that you can send quite a lot of cash in one go (even up to $50,000-$100,000) with most banks. In addition, an international online transaction can be pulled through either by walking into a branch or over the phone. Expect some delays in clearing a transaction though; depending on where you are sending money to and from, there could be a delay of up to four or five business days. This means getting money quickly to someone abroad in an emergency is usually not an option with Bank transfers. Also, beware of the fees in this situation — you may incur transaction fees or a high exchange rate from some banks. The receiver may also have to pay a bank fee to be able to collect the cash you send them. While bank transfers were traditionally the most common method of transferring money abroad in years past, advancements in technology have given rise to the more sophisticated and user-friendly options, in the form of FinTech payment providers.",
    FinTech_companies_P: "Financial technology or FinTech companies entice with varying offerings. Some of them charge a transfer fee but provide competitive exchange rates. Others charge no fees but require up to 3-4 days for your funds to reach the intended account. Deciding which one to choose depends on what you are after and the method of sending. Will you use a credit/debit card or opt for the funds to be transferred from your bank account? These can determine the fees and delivery time.",
    Money_transfer_operators_P: "When sending money overseas, you will probably find several high-street money transfer operators. These usually offer process times between 24-48 hours, with fees varying depending on the selected method to send money, the location, and the currency. What is paramount, however, before deciding to use their services is to ensure the chosen operator is properly authorized by your country’s governing financial services regulator. In the UK, for example, this would be the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority). Also, take note of the offered exchange rates as some operators’ rates are particularly high, and you may see corresponding high fees as well.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P9: "The best way to transfer money abroad",
    transfer_money_abroad_P10: "Given that cash can be stolen at any given time during a transfer, it's probably best to send it abroad via an online service. That way, you also save yourself from extra charges (i.e., insurance for safe delivery), not to mention the time it will probably take for your funds to arrive. Plus, who really sends physical cash these days? Luckily, with such a wealth of digital services offering easy availability, safety, and convenience, money is rarely sent via the mail anymore.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P11: "It should be noted that choosing a bank wire transfer to send money overseas usually comes with a hefty fee that can range between $45-$60 per transaction. In addition to this, the exchange rate might be higher if you are sending funds in a different currency. This is why money transfer apps, like Cashero, have seen such a rise in the past few years as they offer fast, secure, easy, and cheap money transfer services.

International money orders are also not secure, especially for large sums, because they are often lost in the mail. However, you can replace an international money order (for a fee) if it has not been cashed. Finally, it's best to avoid personal checks.

    transfer_money_abroad_P15: "As already mentioned before, it's critical that the selected organization or service is regulated by the relevant authorities. It's also paramount that they have taken all security measures for safe money transfers.",
    transfer_money_abroad_P16: "What makes a money transfer safe?",

    Tracking: "Tracking",
    Fraud_prevention: "Fraud prevention",
    ID_verification_P: "This can involve using security questions, requiring a secure password, allowing only the intended recipient to pick up your money, and logging you out automatically after a set amount of time has passed since the time you logged in. At Cashero we use One Time Passwords (OPT) to ensure your transfers are secure.",
    Encryption_P: "Some providers offer 256-bit or bank-level encryption to prevent hackers from getting their hands on your personal information.",

    Fraud_prevention_P: "Fraud prevention tactics may be triggered by activities such as sending funds to a suspicious recipient, sending an unusually large number of transfers, and logging in from a different device than the one you created your account with. When that happens, you might be asked to verify your identity with the money transfer provider, provide a confirmation number sent to your phone or email, or answer security questions.",

    Fees_Heading: "Fees",
    Exchange_rates: "Exchange rates",
    Fees_P: "Expect some operating costs when doing business with a foreign exchange company. It's a business after all. This means that they have employees to pay, pay money on things like renewing their licenses, and premises to rent. A portion of these costs is passed on to you via fees. Note that most financial institutions and FX brokers will hardly give you an upfront estimate of such costs.",
    Exchange_rates_P: "These determine how much of a specific currency you can buy with another currency. For example, how many euros you can purchase for $50. There is usually a catch here, though. Some providers add an inflated mark-up on top of the real-time market exchange rate. That way, they are actually asking you to pay for their resources and time. So, it's crucial to understand whether the provider offers real-time exchange rates like the ones you will find via Reuters or Google – with no fees or mark-ups.",

So with some providers, the money transfer process can take a few minutes, while others require five or more business days to clear your transaction. Note that sending money during bank holidays or over a weekend may affect the time your money transfer takes significantly. That is if you're using primarily bank transfers. When you go with online providers, you can ensure that no matter the day or time, be it a holiday or weekend, your money always gets where you need it to go, almost instantly.",
