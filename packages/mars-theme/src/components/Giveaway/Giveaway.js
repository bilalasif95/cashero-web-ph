								<h1>Cashero’s Golden Ticket Giveaway!</h1>
								<div className="custom-border mb-5"></div>
								<p>Welcome to Cashero’s Golden Ticket Giveaway! This isn’t another t-shirt or water bottle giveaway gimmick. We’re giving you early access to Cashero and the chance to win actual cash. All you have to do is spread the word about Cashero and you will have the chance to win $1000 every 3 days! How, you ask? Well let’s go through the rules.</p>
							</div>



							<div className="terms_titles">
								<h3>HOW CAN I JOIN THE GIVEAWAY?</h3>
								<p>Anyone over the age of 16 is eligible to participate. To join the contest, enter your phone number on our website and we’ll text you a link to download the app. Alternatively, you can download the Cashero app through the App Store or Google Play Store.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="terms_titles">
								<h3>HOW ARE GOLDEN TICKETS AWARDED?</h3>
								<p>First off, you automatically get a golden ticket from us just for downloading the app and registering (thanks for being an early supporter of Cashero!). To collect more golden tickets, all you have to do is let other people know how great Cashero is. Everytime a friend, business or charity successfully signs up for Cashero using your unique referral link, you are awarded a golden ticket. </p>
								<p>Each golden ticket increases your odds of winning the $1,000 prize. <span className="br-block"></span> Keep an eye on our social media channels because we’ll also be giving away golden tickets from time to time to lucky users!</p>
							</div>

							<div className="terms_titles">
								<h3>WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IF I AM THE LUCKY WINNER?</h3>
								<p>Every 3 days one lucky Cashero user will win $1000! The more golden tickets you have, the greater your chance to win. If you don’t win, you’ll still be able to carry your golden tickets to the next draw. </p>
								<p>By the way, if you’re the lucky winner, you’ll notice your Cashero account balance will increase by $1000. And yup, you guessed correctly, you’re earning interest on your prize money which means it’s the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="terms_titles">
								<h3>CAN I WITHDRAW MY PRIZE MONEY?</h3>
								<p>Yes! You will be able to withdraw your funds (and the interest you’ve accrued) once Cashero is live. At that point you must go through KYC, our Know Your Customer identity verification just to make sure you are who you say you are. Prize money can only be withdrawn and cannot be sent to other users as a payment.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="terms_titles">
								<h3>HOW DOES CASHERO CHOOSE THE WINNERS FOR THE GIVEAWAY?</h3>
								<p>Cashero will select a winner at random every 3 days from the pool of Golden Ticket entries. This will be done at Cashero’s sole discretion, from all eligible participants. Participants can only win once. </p>
							</div>

							<div className="terms_titles">
								<h3>WHEN DOES THE GIVEAWAY END?</h3>
								<p>The Golden Ticket campaign is a prize draw that takes place every 3 days over the next 2 months, from the beginning of April 2021 to the end of June 2021. The first prize draw will be held on April 3rd and the last prize draw will be held on May 31st.</p>
