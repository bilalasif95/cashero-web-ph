                  To join the contest, enter your phone number on our website
                  and we’ll text you a link to download the app. Alternatively,
                  you can download the Cashero app through the App Store or

                <h3>HOW ARE GOLDEN TICKETS AWARDED?</h3>
                <p>
                  First off, you automatically get a Golden Ticket from us just
                  for downloading the app and registering (thanks for being an
                  early supporter of Cashero!). To collect more Golden Tickets,
                  all you have to do is let other people know how great Cashero
                  is. Every time a friend, business or charity successfully
                  signs up for Cashero using your unique referral link, you are
                  awarded a Golden Ticket. Each Golden Ticket increases your
                  odds of winning from the jackpot.

                <h3>WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IF I AM THE LUCKY WINNER?</h3>
                <p>
                  Every 3 days one lucky Cashero user will win $1000! The more
                  Golden Tickets you have, the greater your chance to win. If
                  you don’t win, you’ll still be able to carry your Golden
                  Tickets to the next draw.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the way, if you’re the lucky winner, you’ll notice your
                  Cashero account balance will increase by $1000. And yup, you
                  guessed correctly, you’re earning up to 5% interest on your
                  prize money. Plus, you can always win again so keep referring
                  more friends to Cashero.

                <h3>WHAT IS THE REFERRAL BONUS?</h3>
                <p>
                  When you refer friends you will increase your odds of winning
                  from the jackpot. For every friend that you refer that wins
                  the $1000 prize, you will get a referral bonus of 10% of their
                  winnings. Simply put, if someone you referred wins, you will
                  also receive $100 into your wallet because you invited them to
                  Cashero.

                <h3>HOW DOES CASHERO CHOOSE THE WINNERS FOR THE GIVEAWAY?</h3>
                <p>
                  Cashero will select a winner at random every 3 days from the
                  pool of Golden Ticket entries. This will be done at Cashero’s
                  sole discretion, from all eligible participants. You can win
                  more than once.

                <p>
                  Yes! You will be able to withdraw your funds (and the interest
                  you’ve accrued) once Cashero is live. At that point you must
                  go through KYC, our Know Your Customer identity verification
                  just to make sure you are who you say you are. Prize money can
                  only be withdrawn and cannot be sent to other users as a
                  payment.
